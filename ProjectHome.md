# Getting Started With Native ARM Programming #

Write your ARM programs in an easy, clear native manner.

Drastically reduces the development time.

ARM SoC is considered as a simple microcontroller with 32-bit bus width, Giga IPS, Hundreds Megabytes of RAM and Tens of Gigabytes of external storage memory!

First version was based on cheapest ARM9 Development Board (about $80 for the FriendlyARM mini2440 w/ a color 3.5" LCD or Samsung SBC 2440 ARM9).

By now the version for **Samsung S5PV210 SoC (Cortex-A8)** have built. It was developed and works on the FriendlyARM's Mini210s Development Board with H43 4.3"LCD (or other LCD, must also work on Samsung SBC X210). All user's programming examples may be built using the same well-known Metrowerks CodeWarrior for ARM Developer Suite v1.2 If you are interested, please take a look at: http://physicalcomputing.ru/articles_en/p_rt-210_en.html
Also you'll get more computational power with Floating Point co-processor, 512 Megabytes of RAM, use of SDHC Cards, low power consumption.


All projects were 100% tested and work under RT-210/StartOS - small operating system for ARM platform.
It's simple, fast, reliable, user-friendly op sys with  time-proved characteristics taken from mini-, microcomputers, Handhelds and microcontrollers.
Features are: smallest footprint (as low as 32 K bytes), shortest boot time - about one second, loading and launching the User's programs from an SD card into the RAM, System APIs are working via software interrupts, granting the User total control over hardware, native C, C++ and Assembler programming. Clear and extremely small programs.



StartOS/RT-210 are free of charge for education and evaluation purposes.

For commercial use of RT-210/StartOS please contact Anatoly Besplemennov (longtolik@gmail.com).

StartOS/RT-210 isn't open source just by simple reasons. Project's ideology and algorithms are controlled by one person. The code is very compact, carefully cleaned and optimized. Author still keeps the hope to find a sponsor for speed up the development.

**_Note.You can test the new version launching StartOS binary from an SD card. Next, burn it into the NAND flash_**
