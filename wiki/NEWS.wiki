System now supports FAT32 SD cards only. There're some problems reading SD cards. Maybe contacts. Try some times. I work for stable reading.
_____________________________________________________________
  
  System works fast. Cold start (and your program too) *<1 second.*

 To launch the *screen calibration procedure:*
 - tap the screen and hold pen pressed at least 5 seconds

 No more counter of launches.

 With proper SD card you can see up to 15 files on menu screen.

 Some functions are in progress.

 One of them already present (for sliders, knobs, etc.)

  New touchscreen function:


  int 	Read_TS	(U32 *x, U32 *y);


	Usage:


int	pen_down;	// You'll get pen status as funct() return

int	x;		// pen x will be placed here

int	y;		// pen y will be placed here

....	...	...	...	...

	pen_down=Read_TS(&(x),&(y));	// Put X,Y addresses and Read_TS will fill them with X,Y

	if (pen_down)
	{

...  ...  use x and y here

...  ...	...	...

	}
		
    *  Hope see you soon...*
