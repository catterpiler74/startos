# If the system don't work for the very first time

== EEPROM specific ==

 Some users report when they first time try to load StartOS it's cycling and rebooting.
 In this case please run once test2440 in EEPROM part.
 Then StartOS must work.

 It's because the differences in hardware made in various years.
 Also StartOS writes the Touch Screen calibration data in EEPROM with another methods then test2440 (uses the fast way).
