=== EEPROM specific ===

 Some users report when they first time try to load StartOS it's cycling and rebooting. Also, when screen calibrating was not accurate, X or Y coordinates of the corners may get the same values.

 In these cases please *run once test2440 in EEPROM part*.
 Then StartOS must work.

 It's because of the differences in hardware.
 The StartOS writes the Touch Screen calibration data in EEPROM using other methods then test2440.
