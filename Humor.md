CS professor at students' auditory:

- John Smith, what are you doing right now?

- I'm just making an Operation System Lunwixdrid!

- OK, from what components, what do you use?

- Many pieces of Data, some pieces of Code and a lot of shit.

Professor (hands up over his head) - Immediately Stop this!


Next Day professor:

- And Today, John, what is in your plans?

- Coding a new op sys - Smallos.

- And what do you think to mix?

- Some Data, Code.

- And have you add a shit?

- No Sir, I'm afraid, it's impossible!
